# TezkCore
A simple, custom, essentials plugin for my Minecraft Java development test server

* Stops players from placing/destorying blocks as per configuration
* Colourful MOTD with configurable colour settings
* Simple /speed <1-5> command to change player flying speed
* Simple customisable login message
* Other essentials including /spawn and /tezkcore reload commands
